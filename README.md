# Loan Default Prediction Model Analysis
# Overview of the Analysis
The aim of this analysis is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting loan default. The purpose is to assist the company in assessing the risk associated with loan applicants and making informed decisions.

# Results
Accuracy Score: The accuracy of the model is 99%, indicating that 99% of the predictions made by the model are correct.

Precision Score:
Class 0 (Non-default): 100%
Class 1 (Default): 87%

Recall Score:
Class 0: 100%
Class 1: 89%


# Summary
The machine learning model exhibits high performance in predicting loan defaults. It achieves a high accuracy score of 99%, indicating its ability to make accurate predictions. The precision and recall scores further validate the model's effectiveness, with precision and recall for Class 0 (non-default) predictions and slightly lower precision (87%) but still high recall (89%) for Class 1 (default) predictions.

Given its accuracy and robust performance metrics, this model could be recommended for deployment by the company. Its ability to accurately identify both non-default and default cases could make it a valuable tool for risk assessment in loan processing. Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the model's performance are recommended to ensure its reliability and effectiveness over time.
